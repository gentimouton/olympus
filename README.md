inspired by Neil Gaiman's american gods, 
UI similar to Reigns (except church/mil/merch/pop gauges are different)

Each god has 1 or more functions.

# ideas

* start as god of a tiny function (god of jewelry, cheating husbands, padlocks)
* gain popularity/power/mana by taking decisions, like in Reigns.
* powers unlock at certain mana thresholds.
* spend mana to absorb/take over functions from smaller gods.

### Goals
* Reach N mana.
* Absorb N gods.
* Acquire N powers.

### powers
* nature: 1) animals (wandering cats, birds, kraken), 2) weather (season, storm, sea), 3) time (night/day).
* interactions: 1) possess an oracle (Pythia), 2) take human form, charm a woman, and make a semigod doing deeds generating fame for you (Zeus: Hercules), 
* professions: smiths, prostitutes, politicians, warriors
